# TicTacToe in JavaScript + TypeScript refactor + React refactor

## Using TypeScript

Install TypeScript from scratch: `yarn global add typescript`

> Hint: Remember to add `export PATH=$(yarn global bin):$PATH` to your `~/.bashrc` file and then run `source ~/.bashrc` to load changes on current terminal window.

Compile TypeScript file into JavaScript code: `tsc js/index.ts`

On `/ts-refactor` you can run `yarn tsc` to use TypeScript (after installing dependencies of package.json with `yarn install`)
